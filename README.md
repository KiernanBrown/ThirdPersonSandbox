## Features <a name="features"></a>
* A sample scene where you can move a character around in third person and the camera follows you.
* The foundation of a combo system. Left clicking allows you to attack, and doing attacks in succession allows you to do up to a four hit combo. You can stop for a brief period after an attack to restart the combo.

* The foundation of combo modifiers, which are moves that can be used to modify a combo, but can only be used mid combo. Right clicking after doing one of the first three hits in the combo allows you to perform a stomp, which restarts your combo.
